**Openscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time.** We offer mentorship, training, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind. Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](/about#NCEAS)) and incubated by [Mozilla](/about#MOZILLA).

## OUR STORY

The Openscapes story starts with file names like "data_analysis_final_v2b.xls" — you know the ones. 

In 2013, when a team of scientists at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) was leading the second annual Ocean Health Index assessment, they found themselves struggling with unruly documentation buried in forwarded emails and knew they needed to find a better way to analyze data in a collaborative way. 

So they turned to open source tools – the same used by software engineers — whose resources and supportive online communities were game-changing. Not only did the efficiency of the team's analyses increase, so too did their impact and reach thanks to open source communication channels. They found these open workflows to be so empowering that they shared their story — [our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) — with the scientific community through a publication in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, led by Openscapes founder Julia Lowndes. 

The ideas in that paper seeded the vision for Openscapes, and that vision became a reality in the fall of 2018, when Mozilla (yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox) awarded Julia a fellowship to launch the initiative. The long-term home of Openscapes will be with NCEAS as an important component of its work in environmental data science and training. 

As Openscapes moves forward, we look forward to opening the landscapes of science and sharing more stories to help create an efficient, open culture for science. If you work in the environmental science realm, we invite you to be part of this story. We are all in this together. Let’s do better science in less time.

## OUR TEAM

Openscapes has many supportive contributors at NCEAS, Mozilla, and the broader open community. 

**Julia "Julie" Stewart Lowndes** is the founding director of Openscapes. Julia champions kinder, better science in less time through open data science and teamwork. As a marine data scientist, Mozilla Fellow '19 and Senior Fellow at NCEAS, she has 7+ years designing and leading programs to empower science teams with skillsets and mindsets for reproducible research, empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been building communities of practice in this space since 2013 with the Ocean Health Index after earning her PhD at Stanford University studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. She is a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor, lead creator of the Ocean Health Index's [open data science training](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/), and a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). [Learn more](http://jules32.github.io) about Julia, [email](mailto:lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu) her, and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliesquid).

**Erin Robinson** works at the intersection of community informatics, Earth science and non-profit management — building communities. Over the last 15 years, she has honed an eclectic skill set both technical and managerial, creating communities and programs with lasting impact around open science, data, and technology. Erin earned a M.Sc. at Washington University in St. Louis in 2010, where she began building communities of practice to support Air Quality researchers' understanding of long-range smoke and dust events. Erin was Executive Director of the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) from 2014-2020, and served as chair of AGU's Data Management Advisory Board from 2014-2020. Erin is the co-founder of Metadata Game Changers, LLC and serves as an ad-hoc advisor to the NASEM Roundtable on Aligning Incentives for Open Science.

## MOZILLA

Mozilla believes the internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Its work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). Mozilla focuses on fueling the movement for a healthy internet by supporting a diverse group of [fellows](https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/directory) working on key internet issues; by connecting open internet leaders at events like [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/); by publishing critical research in the [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/); and by rallying citizens around advocacy issues that connect the wellbeing of the internet directly to everyday life.

## OUR VISION & ETHOS

Our vision is a scientific culture that is more efficient and collaborative, and can uncover environmental solutions faster. Openscapes opens the landscapes of science by growing communities of practice around environmental open data science. This means promoting open science and using the internet for good. It also means enabling open culture driven by collaboration, empathy, and kindness. We aim to create a positive open culture in science, so we can do better science in less time.

## OUR ART

Allison Horst creates original art for Openscapes, beginning as an artist in residence at NCEAS. Allison is an [Assistant Teaching Professor](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/allison-horst) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She is also one of the inaugural Openscapes Champions. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst). 

See all of Allison's open landscapes on the [**gallery page**](/gallery).
