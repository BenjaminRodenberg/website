Focused in environment, now biomed for CZI
Some tools and cutural differences
Cross-cutting similarities: never taught how be a modern coder that leverages the internet, donâ€™t have a culture of kindness.

Welcoming entryways

I've always talked about Openscapes centered on the "what" : getting jazzed about open data science. But during COVID i've been focusing on the "how": 
and welcoming entryways

- new coders to R and collaborative, reproducible and open pratices
- seasoned coders to GitHub
- scientists to open science through data science and publishing
- meeting design

Openscapes not just environmental science. Our roots are here with the community that we grew up with but it is much more. CZI and Mozilla.
