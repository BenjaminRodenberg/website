*I wanted to write about the details of our 2-day workshop, which went really well! But in the light of CoronaVirus and the move to remote workshops, I'm going to think more about the remote aspects....*



TODO: link accompanying blogs

TODO: Also, a seminar and seaside chat the day before. Pics by Gavin Fay https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM8HSpx3iEfurvm_R7OxhA98kECGIIBKW1YSuroAAYDVB9f614BUIwhJNFRIcWPAA?key=Mk5wbXNxSndJQlRNT3BHSjFFS1FsamZ2Skx5bEtn

This is my list of TODOs following the February workshop.

What we'll improve upon

- clear statement in Overview that this is not all about R. Even though it is very heavily R. 
- add more stories from previous Champions cohorts, show what's possible
- add about broader open science/scholarship landscape: FORCE11 & publishing, open data repos Dryad/KNB/DataONE. FORCE11 community working on this, open publishing. PreReview, JOSS, rOpenSci, EOSS. Change rewards structure

- check out https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/design-ds-classroom/materials/02-teach-tidyverse/slides/02-teach-tidyverse.html#31 

- add more guidance about starting coding clubs. St

- notice that the vast majority is windows, need keyboard shortcuts!
- give better prompts for breakout groups
- pay attention to filepaths! And anchors. Eg: 
  - To Install R and RStudio and tidyverse for the first time: 
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites 
  - (knitted RMarkdowns allow anchoring urls: in the link above the #prerequisites title is a header within the introduction.Rmd file)

- Twitter part
  - started with rstats, but greater life advice as well
  - Tim O'Reilly: social media is not just about getting attention. It’s a more powerful tool for giving attention. (like I said for Jamie) http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/03/socialcivics-and-the-architecture-of-participation.html

## Structure, from keep

## Agenda update

- Add to agenda: focus is bailt, helping your teams do what our team did. It started w 1 champion, with resistant member and lead. Not me! 
- Add to mindset: iteration and imperfection towards innovationand interoperability. We have guilt and overwork and this is not meant to add to that. This is about  engaging your interest and empoerign you to get involved as you can. Whatever works for you is great. Best exercise

## Slide updates
- CoC: learn more about current ideas "best intent"
- Twitter: I also follow people from Mozilla, DEI. I've learned a lot about the conversations going on, more than I would from my own office
- how to start coding clubs/ seaside chats/ hackathons. Examples that work, stories how they got started. If it's too much extra work or not fun, you're not going to do it. The best kind of exercise is what you'll actually do. Find this quote.
- source files: add modular workflows, sourcing files, knitting children
- if you're new to R, Swirl! Install R from r4ds. 
- BSILT: the whole Openscapes program is built around BSILT. Trying to operationalize this. It started with one Champion. not me. got buy-in. 


What am I missing from not using twitter?
Finding out info
Finding community
You have to learn how to sift through attitudes/frequency of tweets. Learn how to navigate
Gavin: StoryCollider workshop from twitter
You only follow the things you’re interested in
Plugin on my browser: enough time on twitter, shouldn’t you be working


Leaderful teams. Strong leadership, empower grass-roots. That's me!
