Champions, we are teaching PIs and their labs together. We've focused on the PIs, but really everyone is a champion and we'll have to figure out how to communicate all of this. It's hard. 

Specifically chose my generation of PIs. Why? They learned this stuff on their own the hard way. And need to see that their students don't have to suffer the way they did. And the lab will be better for it. Efficiency and  mental health.

Openscapes is really about creating a culture in our scientific labs that is healthy and happy. 

Really trying to replicate how the Ocean Health Index team at NCEAS works. We are a small team, but with big impact. PI enabled us. 

It's really hard to teach both PIs and their labs. Maybe that's why people don't try to do it. But it's worth it. 
Introducing new concepts and asking everyone to be ok with learning together. That means PIs giving agency and being humble about not having all the answers. And it means lab members stepping up into leadership roles. Some of the labs with the most unity have a "reproduciblity czar". 

How to empower but not overwhelm. This is really hard. especially in teaching PIs and lab members together: there are different expectations for these groups adn how do you communicate that. PIs: you don't have time, you aren't doing data analysis every day. So when I introduce cool R packages and say you can contribute, I'm not really talking to you. But it's important you see that this is possible because you can see that this is possible and support your lab, who is doing dat analaysis every day, to take thte time to do this. And you can also advocate at faculty meetings. Find allies, band together with your deans. 
And lab memebers, when I

There is a real power dynamic. Name it. 



Here are all of the awesome Champions lab meembers. Keep an eye out for them as they do amazing things in their current labs and take these principles ot their next jobs as PhD students, post docs, etc.
