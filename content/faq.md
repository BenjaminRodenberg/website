The Openscapes [Champions Program](https://openscapes/org/champions) is not a typical training workshop for individuals. **Through Openscapes you focus on your own work with your team.** We we introduce modern collaborative open data science concepts, tooling, and examples from your peers, your team focuses on where you are and where you want to go together.

## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM: TEAMS

### What is a team/How do I choose my team? 

There is a lot of flexibility in choosing your team for the Openscapes Champions program. We designed it with academic research groups in mind, to provide resilience where there is high turnover and folks might be struggling with similar challenges around data analysis while working on different projects. But we're increasingly working with research groups of different kinds and needs! We expect a range of technical ability and training experience; most importantly is selecting folks that have interest in improving their data analysis practices and developing collaboration and leadership skills. 

Teams do not need to have a specific shared research project to participate. The idea is that by developing shared open data science habits within the research group, it will be easier to onboard new folks and offboard knowledge/data/code/etc when folks leave. And, as more and more research groups work this way, it can ease transitions between research groups (i.e. when students graduate and take a position with a different research group).

The Champions Program is structured for teams with the intent that research group leads (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc) and members (students, post-docs, analysts, lab managers, etc.) participate as a team together. This is a strategy so that the lead does not necessarily have to be an expert/comfortable with open data science to enable their team to design open data science workflows. Group leads and members participate together so that: 

1. everyone sees and values what is possible with open data science 
2. leads enable members to invest time in learning skills and developing shared workflows as part of their jobs
3. members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open data science concepts into their work
4. everyone champions open data science and contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and beyond, in whatever capacity their roles and circumstances (time limitations & responsibilities) allow. 

Choosing your team can be based on interests around data analysis and around leadership. There are no prerequisite skills to participate, just an interest to learn and contribute. The “homework” between Champions sessions and beyond is to meet with your full research group (beyond workshop participants, and optional for the lead) to establish shared workflows and habits within the research group. 

### Does a team need a shared research project?

No, the idea is to help individuals within a research group *see* themselves as part of a team. With this team mindset, your most important collaborator is Future You. Working with Future You in mind helps you spend more time on answering awesome research questions rather than trying to make sense of `data_analysis_finalv2b.xls`. And a team mindset also includes Future Us in the research group, so that onboarding and offboarding is more efficient and so that participation in science can be more inclusive and equitable.

### Is attendance required for all Cohort Calls? 
Yes; we do try to have everyone on the team attend all Cohort Calls – but know that sometimes that's not possible. The Cohort Calls are synchronous: in 90 mins, we teach for ~30 and the rest of the time is you discussing and applying open data science ideas to your own work with your team, and learning from your fellow champions. All the lessons, slides, and also recordings are available if people have to miss, but everyone should sign up expecting to be at the Cohort Calls. 

### Do I as the PI need to attend the Cohort Calls, or just my team?
It’s important that team leads attend with their team. The Champions program is designed to reduce the burden for PIs in the long term and develop leadership within and across their teams. With this investment now, team leads and members will build resilient and enduring practices for their research group, even as that research group changes into the future. The idea is that together, the whole team sees what's possible with open data science and builds confidence, ownership, and a shared pathway forward. Then it's the entire team, not just the PI, who puts it to practice in between sessions.

## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM: COHORTS

### Does a cohort need a shared research project or to be closely related?

No, the cohort does not need a shared project; each team will work on what they need to for their own research. Teams within a cohort do not need to be closely related, but having teams somewhat related is good for community building (i.e. environmental science or psychology).


### Can we have smaller teams so more teams can participate in a cohort?

From our experiences so far think that ~8 teams with 4-5 participants per team (maximum of ~40 participants) is a good size so there is time for everyone to be engaged and contributing (and not feeling like a passive webinar). Also, having a good amount of members per team is really key to the whole model of Openscapes: we want to reduce the amount of burden for PIs to have to relay info to their research groups. Having more members participate as a team in the Openscapes program helps more team members feel agency to build resilient systems with less transmission time.

Thanks for your email and I hope you’re doing well too. That’s exciting that the Champions program has come up! We so far have not grown to a point where teams can pay for a single slot within a cohort; we are working towards this but currently have pricing to book full cohorts for specific communities. A note too that neither teams nor cohorts of teams need to have a collaborative project in order to participate; the idea is that researchers working "independently" on different projects/phd theses/grants benefit by operating as a team across their different projects so there is less reinventing and time/money lost. Openscapes' team-cohort model helps make this happen.

A cohort for the 4-month Champions program (8 remote sessions 2x/month) covers time and overhead for Erin Robinson and me to coordinate folks, iterate, and deliver the program. Also of potential interest to you: we’ve developed a longer-term community approach for NASA that we expect to be really impactful moving forward, which includes the 4-month Champions program but also provides a framework to scale open data science practices sustainably within specific communities by developing community members as Openscapes Champions facilitators, as part of their existing jobs (i.e. data managers, librarians). This NASA grant is $300K/year for 3 years, which covers some of our time as well as that of our partners so that we can best meet community needs. 

We’re definitely interested in what your needs are and if there would be something we could co-design with you – we've also been curious how this NASA approach might also work for funders and their grantees. Erin and I would be happy to have a call to chat further with you and share what we’ve been learning as we’ve experimented with different shapes and sizes of Openscapes.


### I don’t code/I am a master coder, why should I participate? 

Openscapes Champions is about reframing data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. Our working hypothesis is that normalizing data analysis as a collaborative effort will help build efficiency, continuity, and resilience in your research group, and make science more inclusive and equitable. 

The Champions program is for teams: this means a lead and members. The PI should be invested...
