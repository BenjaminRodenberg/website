## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM FAQs

### What is a team/How do I choose my team? 

We designed the Openscapes Champions program with academic research groups in mind, to provide resilience where there is high turnover and folks might be struggling independently with similar challenges around data analysis. But we're increasingly working with research groups of different kinds and needs! Teams don't need to have a specific shared research project to participate. The idea is that by developing shared open data science habits within the research group, it will be easier to onboard new folks and offboard knowledge/data/code/etc when folks leave. And, it will empower everyone to seed this change more broadly within their current communities and as they move on to other positions (i.e. when grad students defend).

The Champions Program is structured for teams with the intent that research group leads (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc) and members (students, post-docs, analysts, lab managers, etc.) participate as a team together. This is a strategy so that the lead does not necessarily have to be an expert/comfortable with open data science to enable their team to design open data science workflows. Group leads and members participate together so that: 

1. everyone sees and values what is possible with open data science 
2. leads enable members to invest time in learning skills and developing shared workflows as part of their jobs
3. members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open data science concepts into their work
4. everyone champions open data science and contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and beyond, in whatever capacity their roles and circumstances (time limitations & responsibilities) allow. 

Choosing your team can be based on interests around data analysis, but also around leadership. There are no prerequisite skills to participate, just an interest to learn and contribute. The “homework” between Champions sessions and beyond is to meet as a full research group (beyond workshop participants, and optional for the lead) to establish shared workflows and habits within the research group. 

### Does a team need a shared research project?

No, the idea is to help individuals within a research group *see* themselves as part of a team. With this team mindset, your most important collaborator is Future You. Working with Future You in mind helps you spend more time on answering awesome research questions rather than trying to make sense of `data_analysis_finalv2b.xls`. And a team mindset also includes Future Us in the research group, so that onboarding and offboarding is more efficient and science can be more inclusive and equitable.

### Does a cohort need a shared research project or be closely related?

No, the cohort does not need a shared project; each team will work on what they need to for their own research. Teams within a cohort do not need to be closely related, but having teams somewhat related is good for community building (i.e. environmental science, or fisheries science).

### I don’t code/I am a master coder, why should I participate? 

Openscapes Champions is about reframing data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. Our working hypothesis is that normalizing data analysis as a collaborative effort will help build efficiency, continuity, and resilience in your research group, and make science more inclusive and equitable. 

The Champions program is for teams: this means a lead and members. The PI should be invested...
