## A Qualitative Data Analysis Chat with Dr. Beth Duckles

Our First 2022 Openscapes Community Call featured a chat with[Beth Duckles PhD](https://bethduckles.com), a research consultant and social scientist. Beth helps technologists, designers and scientists gather and use human-centered data, supporting folks who are trying out their mixed methods or qualitative skills and want coaching and partnership in conducting and analyzing their research. Beth is also the Founder and Co-Director of [Open Post Academics](https://openpostac.org/) (formerly the Athenas), an online peer-support community for people with a Ph.D. who have left or are considering leaving academia. The recording is on [Openscapes YouTube](https://youtu.be/ex4KVnWDMDQ).

Our conversation was about Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) - what it is and how it can be used for evaluation. Specifically, we talked about how it can be used to evaluate the Openscapes Champions program. We had some funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to experiment with this.

**What is QDA?** This slide from a talk about [Qualitative Research Using Open Tools](https://zenodo.org/record/2673016#.YlBMgLhlBpQ) with Beth and Vicky Rampin (nee Steeves) provides a short summary: 

> QDA is the systematic collection, organization and interpretation of unstructured data (e.g. interview transcripts, public documents, focus groups, open-ended survey questions). After a close reading of the qualitative data, researchers will assign "codes" or themes to relevant quotes and/or sections of video/audio/images.

"Coding" in the context of QDA means tagging the textual data to reveal patterns in the data.

**A qualitative lesson for quantitative researchers**: Small amounts of qualitative work can make your quantitative work better! For example, before you create a multiple choice question in a survey, be sure you know what types of answers people want to give, or you'll collect bad data by restricting their answers. Do some QDA first!

Beth has been working with Openscapes to see whether QDA methods can be used with Google Doc Agendas (like this one!) to evaluate learning over time. One of the first things we learned was that the time scale of our Theory of Change was too big for the timescale of a Champions cohort. We did discover some common themes among Cohort participants such as the themes of "time" (Do I have time to do x?), "Writing things down" (where the data is being stored), and onboarding/offboarding of folks coming in and out of labs. This information helps us recognize the needs of future Cohorts and adapt accordingly.
