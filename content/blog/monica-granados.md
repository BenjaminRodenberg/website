## A casual conversation with Dr. Monica Granados to discuss the Open Climate Campaign and how we can reimagine open science as part of the climate movement

Our 7th Openscapes Community Call featured a "celebrity interview" with [Monica Granados](https://www.monicagranados.com/), PhD. Monica is the [Open Climate Campaign](https://openclimatecampaign.org/) Manager at Creative Commons and on the Leadership team of [PREreview](https://www.prereview.org/). She is an open science specialist and a trained ecologist. Monica was interviewed by Julie Lowndes, PhD, Openscapes Director. Watch the recording on Openscapes YouTube. **ADD LINK**

In this conversation, we dug into what each of us can do to connect our daily work to the climate movement. **How do we connect "big problems" like climate change with "little problems" like sharing knowledge, data, different versions of files, and automating analyses & reports?** We wanted to come away with concrete actions we can all weave into our daily work:

-   If climate is part of your day job, how to leverage open science
-   If open science is part of your day job, how to connect that to climate

> We underestimate the power of contribution\--of acting within our own sphere of influence to tackle the piece of the problem that is right in front of us. - Abigail Dillen in Litigating in a Time of Crisis, in [All We Can Save](https://www.allwecansave.earth/anthology)

After the interview, participants contributed to a rich conversation with questions touching on which workflows should be streamlined to reduce the time required to discover, connect, and coordinate around open science; funding models; licensing; and differences in how open science for climate is moving forward in governments, universities, and elsewhere.
