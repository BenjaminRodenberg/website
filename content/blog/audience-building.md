*Last month I was invited to give a workshop at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software virtual conference. The workshop was about Audience Building for Open Source Projects, focused on strategic planning and sustainability. I was both nervous and excited to give this workshop: nervous because I am by no means an expert in how to  grow and sustain a project — Openscapes is still nascent (and currently unfunded). But I was excited because although I am not an expert, I do know a lot and jumped at the opportunity to pass forward what I've learned.*

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software program supports and connects folks building open source software for science. I was very excited to attend to meet folks and learn about the cool things they are developing. And, I was excited to see a [keynote by Kate Bouman](https://twitter.com/ReaderMeter/status/1336413615331528704), whose team used open algorithms and open data to "make" the first image of a black hole! 

I was invited to give a workshop about audience building and strategic planning for open source projects. Here is the abstract I wrote for the workshop:

> Open source software is about more than code: it’s about welcoming a broadening audience to a shared vision and planning for sustainability. We’ll cover considerations for open source programs including messaging & "marketing", onboarding, inclusion, community building, web presence & technology choices, and fundraising, using Openscapes strategies as a starting example.

I framed the workshop in broad categories: communication, community building, and sustainability. We talked about each category in turn, although the process is not linear, it's iterative, reinforcing, and overlapping. Essentially, there are many things to do at the same time that are all linked together. And the overarching themes that come up throughout the whole process — built into everything you do, into every decision you make — is openness, inclusion, and maintenance. So, for every decision you make, you should ask yourself: am I being as open as I can be, am I being as inclusive as I can be, and will I be able to maintain what I'm starting. This will help prioritize where you put your efforts.

I have learned a lot from many mentors and programs that I have been introduced to in the past several years. But I highlighted the main resources that frame my thinking for how I think about audience building:
