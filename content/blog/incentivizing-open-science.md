*In early November I had the honor to speak at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) [Roundtable on Aligning Incentives for Open Science](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-aligning-incentives-for-open-science). This Roundtable has been convening thought leaders and stakeholders to identify the whats, whys, and hows of open science policies and incentives, and they have drafted a Toolkit, primarily intended for university leadership, academic department chairs, research funders, and government agencies audiences. It is really exciting to have open science being such a focus at the National Academies, and I was invited to provide a researcher perspective, and provide opinions on priorities for funding open science.*

My talk was called "How to empower researchers with open science through meeting analytical needs and supporting people". The main point was that we can normalize open science through addressing the analytical needs of research teams, and that we must fund people that are already working to make this happen and grow the open movement.

There are several ideas there that I then tried to unpack throughout my talk. This also includes that open science is a behavior that we can support researchers to practice, and that this is critical for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in modern science. Additionally, open leaders do jobs that aren’t currently valued in academia, and they are critical to helping normalize open science.

I think that data science should play a bigger part in open science conversations; I have seen that these conversations often happen separately. But data analysis is a really critical place to focus efforts for open science, because working with data is something that all researchers do, and it starts early and extends throughout the research process. Supporting researchers to learn open practices for data science empowers researchers by meeting their analytical needs and turns open science from an idea to a daily benefit. I been defining **open data science** as the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, inclusive practices for data analysis.

After describing how open data science is powerful like the Force from Star Wars (see [my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AmnPV8eLQl9_0EuHQAqp7xBMHcUlcFkM30509BwJkMA/edit?usp=sharing) with artwork by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)), I gave an real-life research example with the Ocean Health Index.

Our Ocean Health Index team found out the hard way that our defaut approaches to data analysis was not reproducible by even ourselves. Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

Two big lessons coming out of this was first that open science was a means or a byproduct of meeting our analytical needs. Open science was not a goal in itself, but a secret power that was unlocked through engaging with the open community. And the second is that the open habits we developed are enduring because they are built on trust and teamwork. These two things have been key design elements for [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org), which I founded last year with a fellowship from Mozilla.

<br> 

I built Openscapes to empower scientists with open data science, focusing on teams and community. **We approach open science as a spectrum, a behavior change, and a movement**. We use data analysis as an entryway to meet scientists where they are, and help develop new skillsets and mindsets but also focus on empowering them as leaders and champions for open science. 

The main way we do this is through Openscapes Champions, which is a mentorship program for research teams. It’s remote-by-design & cohort-based, which enables community building across research teams and universities. I’ve mentored 13 PIs and their team members so far from academia and government, and I have a waiting list of folks that want to participate. 

**The biggest impact is that research teams are working more openly together**. They’ve been able to do this by reframing data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. And what we see from that is that students are able to participate in research faster, grant money is going further, and teams are co-creating norms that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and emerging collaborations across research groups

And **the biggest lesson is the power of teams for normalizing open science**. When we talk about open science it’s often about participating publicly. But the truth is, when researchers aren’t working openly within their research group, it’s hard to expect them to work openly in the public sense. So focusing on empowering teams to collaborate openly can really catalyze enduring change.

Finally, I focused on priorities for funding open science. I see supporting people as a huge unmet need.

I really like this figure from Brian Nosek at the Center for Open Science that shows how to change a research culture. Thanks to so much of the efforts of folks in this room, we’ve made so much awesome progress to make open science possible, easy, rewarding, and required. Now we must support people to make it normative. We need to invest in the human infrastructure that will make this possible. I have two suggestions, following on the themes I’ve talked about that are possible to do now:

**First: sponsor research teams to be trained and mentored by existing efforts**
This means paying for seats so researchers can attend Hackweeks, Meetups, Carpentries workshops, Openscapes cohorts. The benefits are to help meet existing needs with existing programs, and it's little cost, and we can do it now.

**Second: pay the salary for open leaders who train and mentor research teams**
We already exist in academia by various unofficial titles: we are trainers, mentors, research software engineers, community managers. We are often early career, on soft money, with no job security or career path. Creating jobs for us is the ultimate goal but what’s needed right now is to pay our salaries so we can continue doing our work. The benefits are that trainers can focus on training, which meets this critical need and increases continuity of services, and importantly it also reduces the burnout that comes when open leaders do this without full funding and causes them leave academia, which then delays open science progress

**Open leaders do jobs that aren’t currently valued in academia, and they are critical to helping normalize open science.**

I hadn't seen this before my talk but it resonates to me so much:

An additional dimension to our work involves looking at the staffing and human infrastructure powering open technology development, maintenance, governance and stewardship. That volunteer labor and community engagement is often an invisible cost we gloss over in our estimations and recommendations, while also being a core pillar in this work.
