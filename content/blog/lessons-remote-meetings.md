*This publication builds from a previous post: [How to run a remote workshop, Openscapes/Open Leaders-style](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/03/11/how-to-run-a-remote-workshop/). The practices that lead to good meeting design remotely can also be used in person or a hybrid of the two to strengthen community in real life.*

I had the pleasure of writing a piece with Abby Cabunoc Mayes and Chad Sansing that was just published in Open Source Way called [**3 lessons from remote meetings weâ€™re taking back to the office**](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/remote-meetings). Abby and Chad are colleagues from Mozilla that created the incredible [Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/online-meeting-tips/) program and also  [Movement-Building From Home Community Calls](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/new-movement-building-home-community-calls/) to support community building during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

Abby and Chad have been so instrumental in my personal development as an open leader and also designed the remote program design framework which the Openscapes Champions Program is modeled after. They have also been instrumental in the lives of so many others, as they have refined and scaled the OL program, including through [OLx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13NAGmqP_Fb2qjBKePGVZe7awtwnFKZUHtPz8mqbYtsE/present?token=AC4w5Vjf0u1Jtdi7vB3udA5O-S5wIuJuwA%3A1582781847727&includes_info_params=1&eisi=CPP7qe6B8ecCFc8OJAode38EqA#slide=id.g25275a8168_0_260). Thanks for helping so many of us Abby and Chad!

We wrote this piece in April and its focus on inclusion and empathy is even more critical than ever. We all need to be deliberately and actively and tirelessly better to each other; we cannot be passive and assume default approaches are not enough. We need to be actively anti-racist. Openscapes is strengthening this message throughout all our work to show up for racial justice and for true change. Black Lives Matter.
