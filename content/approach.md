We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven research and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. These are critical to uncovering science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of the research community. 

We know that daily demands leave little time to transition to better data practices and open science, which can be lonely and overwhelming. We created Openscapes from our own research experiences as an approach to [better science in less time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). **We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement**. We use data analysis as an entryway to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skillsets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders and champions for open science. We are influenced and inspired by social justice, climate action, and get out the vote movements.

Openscapes helps researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams. We do this through mentorship, coaching, training, and community organizing to empower researchers as open data science champions and leaders. We use existing tools and resources from the open community along with new resources we create to meet the needs of our community. Our activities include: 

Champions Program
A remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that engages teams in open data science, empowers them with data and leadership skills, and amplifies them as part of the open community. Cohorts are mentored 2x/month over several months following the Champions Lesson Series, as participating teams learn how to supercharge their research.
Openscapes Framework
A multi-year skill-building and community engagement framework for helping research communities transition to open data science workflows. This Openscapes Framework is a year-long series of layered virtual events designed to provide technical and leadership skill-building opportunities that foster overlapping and reinforcing participation while accommodating different needs. We repeat and iterate on the Openscapes Framework each year of the multi-year engagement while rapidly ramping-up leadership training within a specific community so they can self-sufficiently lead the Framework at the end of the grant. 

We share our most current thinking and showcase community efforts through talks and publications on our [media page](/media). Some recent highlights include:
